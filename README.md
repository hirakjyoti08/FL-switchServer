## Switching server on Federated Learning
- Additionally create:
  - A `logs` directory and make seperate log files for both server and client for each node. Eg: `node1_server.log`, `node1_client.log`, `node2_server.log`, `node2_client.log`. (This will be fixed later on where manager itself checks and creates these log files)
